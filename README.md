  For this project, I plan to let the element of surprise play a big role in how this final portfolio comes out. I feel as if keeping the viewer on their toes for what's to come from me makes it that much more interesting. I plan to set up my portfolio similar to a YouTube channel, where you see all the multiple projects on the same page ) like you'd see all a music artist or content creator's videos on their page/channel). I intend to have headers on the side of, or above each project, depending on what's possible given the format of the portfolio. I want to use enticing preview images for each bodies of work (our projects). I'm going to use screenshots, to take a picture of the food for project one that the poem was based off of, and a screenshot of me and Gabriela in our virtual Jimmy Fallon talkshow for project two. For the video game, I intend to do the same, and more than likely screenshot the game title page, . Another option could even be screenshotting a gameplay screen of it as I'm playing my own game. I intendwant my portfolio to not look like a traditional portfolio, but still be comprised of some of the traditional characteristics of one.
